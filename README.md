# Little Esty Shop
https://fast-forest-60065.herokuapp.com/

## Background and Description
"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that requires Turing students to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.

Our project uses many to many relationships to connect merchants, invoices, items, transactions and customers and allows us to access a variety of information gathering options and display them to a website. 
Using TDD and OOP, our team developed an application that utilizes ActiveRecord to join our various databases to achieve desired outputs. In addition, API calls are utilized to reference our project's GitHub repository, and the final project was deployed to the web using Heroku.

## Technologies Utilized
Ruby 2.7.4

Rails 5.2.6
